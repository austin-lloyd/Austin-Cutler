Hello! My name is Austin Cutler, I am a PhD candidate at Florida State University and a research fellow for the LeRoy Collins Institute. My research interests are broadly political behavior, with a special focus on polarization, partisanship, social identity theory, and methods. Much of my research focuses on furthering our understanding of how people form their attitudes and what the consequences of these attitudes are. You can view [**my CV** here](cv.qmd).

Before coming to Florida State, I received my master's from the University of Mississippi in political science in 2021. I received my bachelor's degree from SUNY Geneseo in 2019, where I double majored in political science and anthropology. I grew up in Buffalo, New York (go Bills!), and currently have two dogs, [Roland](roland.jpg) and [Zero](zero.jpg) ([and a bonus picture of them together](zero and roland.jpg)).
