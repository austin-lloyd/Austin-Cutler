I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University. My research interests are broadly political behavior, with a special focus on polrization, partisanship, social identity theory, and race and ethnic politics. I grew up in Buffalo, New York, and currently have two dogs, Roland Jameson Cutler (a Shepard mix) and Zero Nelson Cutler (an American Staffordshire Terrier maybe).
